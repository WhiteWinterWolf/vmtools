## Development tools

These tools are design for vmtools development, they shouldn't be of any use
for end-users.

- `debug.sh`: Get prompt with vmtools libraries and variables loaded, allowing
  to manually call or emulate internal functions.
- `selftest.sh`: vmtools automated testing tool. Quite dirty, it needs to be
  refactored, but it does the job for now.
